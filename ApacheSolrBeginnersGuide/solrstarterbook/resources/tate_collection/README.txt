The example data from Tate collection are taken from:
https://github.com/tategallery/collection

In this directory you will find a copy of the csv used in the examples, which can be used to study the data locally, if the format changed in future updates from the one used in the book. Please refer to the original (and updated) data on the official repository mantained by the Tate Gallery.
